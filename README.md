# AI-Driven Disease Risk Prediction System for Preventive Healthcare

## Overview
Preventive healthcare is critical to improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs
in the United States. Early identification of individuals at risk for chronic diseases enables
timely intervention and more efficient use of medical resources.

This project develops a machine learning–based system to predict disease risk using clinical
and demographic data, supporting data-driven decision-making in preventive healthcare.

## Problem Statement
Chronic diseases such as heart disease are a leading cause of mortality and healthcare
expenditure in the United States. Many cases can be mitigated through early risk detection
and preventive care strategies.

Traditional screening approaches are often reactive and resource-intensive. There is a need
for scalable, data-driven tools that can assist healthcare providers in identifying high-risk
individuals earlier.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a publicly available healthcare dataset containing patient attributes
related to disease risk. The dataset reflects real-world clinical challenges such as
class imbalance and feature variability.

## National Importance and Public Health Impact
AI-driven risk prediction systems can enhance preventive healthcare by enabling early
intervention, reducing hospitalizations, and lowering long-term healthcare costs.

Such systems support public health objectives by improving population health outcomes,
optimizing resource allocation, and strengthening the resilience of the U.S. healthcare system.
